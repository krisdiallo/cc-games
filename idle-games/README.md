# Idle Games

Fills Claude Code's wait-state with interruptible brain games. When you submit
a prompt, a small game pops up in a **side terminal window or tmux pane**; the
moment Claude finishes, it shows your score and gets out of the way.

Five games ship today (press `g` in-game to cycle between them):

| Game | Config name | The gist |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Dungeon** | `dungeon` | A roguelite: one room per wait — telegraphed fights, chests, traps, shrines, merchants; a boss every 5th floor. Your hero **persists forever** (`dungeon.json`): a fight freezes mid-swing when Claude finishes and resumes on your next prompt, and dying banks shards for permanent guild upgrades. |
| Snake | `snake` | Real-time, wasd **or arrow keys**. A run frozen when Claude finishes resumes exactly where it was next prompt; lifetime best persists (`snake.json`). Speeds up as you grow. |
| **Poker** (default) | `poker` | 5-max no-limit hold'em vs four AI personalities (The Rock, The Fish, The Shark, The Prof). Stateful (`poker.json`): bankroll, biggest pot, and the live hand **freeze mid-street and resume** across sessions. Built-in trainer: every decision graded vs pot odds/equity (postflop) or 5-max charts (preflop), EV-priced mistakes, post-hand review, and a recurring leak report — and the villains exploit the same leaks it reports (The Shark bluffs more once you're shown to overfold). Optional `pokerLLM` layer makes villains real `claude -p` (Haiku) players with table talk + a post-hand coach line, with hard timeouts and silent fallback to the offline bots. |
| Trivia | `trivia` | Multiple-choice questions from the bundled bank (+ Open Trivia DB refresh). |
| Sequences | `sequences` | "2, 6, 18, 54, …?" — pick the next term; difficulty ramps with your streak. |
| Word games | `words` | Anagram unscrambles and odd-one-out picks. |
| Simon | `simon` | Watch the pads flash, repeat the sequence; grows by one each success. |
| N-back | `nback` | Letter stream; hit SPACE when the letter matches the one N back. |

Built entirely on Claude Code's **public hooks API** — no patching of the TUI,
no modifying the binary. The game lives in a separate process because
[hooks cannot draw to the Claude Code terminal](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks).

```
UserPromptSubmit ──► start-trivia.sh     ──► (debounce) ──► game in a side pane
PreToolUse       ──► tool-activity.sh    ──► touch <session>.go ──► render NOW (skip the rest of the debounce)
Notification     ──► notify-attention.sh ──► touch <session>.attn ──► ⚠ banner + bell + macOS notification
Pre/PostToolUse  ──► tool-activity.sh    ──► rm <session>.attn (Claude is working again)
Stop/StopFailure ──► stop-trivia.sh      ──► touch <session>.stop ──► game wraps up & closes
SessionEnd       ──► cleanup.sh          ──► kill pane, delete markers
```

**Escape interrupts:** no hook fires when you cancel a turn with Escape (the
docs are explicit about this), so the launcher reads the session transcript
just before rendering — if the turn's last entry is Claude Code's
`[Request interrupted by user…]` marker, nothing is running and no window
opens. An already-open game likewise closes itself after an interrupt has sat
idle for ~45s; a quick Escape-edit-resubmit keeps the window and reuses it.
`StopFailure` (turn died on an API error) is wired to the same wrap-up as
`Stop`, so an errored turn can't strand the game either.

**Claude is waiting on YOU:** when Claude blocks on a permission approval, a
question, or goes idle, the `Notification` hook flips the game into an
unmissable state — a red banner + terminal bell in the pane, plus a macOS
system notification (`systemNotifications` config) that reaches you even if
the game window is buried or closed. The game never steals focus (stray
keystrokes near an approval prompt are dangerous); it tells you loudly and
stays out of the way. The banner lifts on its own the moment Claude resumes.

**One window, ever:** the game takes an exclusive `flock` on
`~/.claude/trivia/game.lock` for its lifetime, so at most one game window
exists across *all* concurrent Claude sessions. Hook scripts pre-check the
lock cheaply and skip spawning; if a race sneaks one through, the duplicate
exits and closes its own window immediately. OS-level locks die with the
process — no stale state.

The first tool call of a turn is the tell that this is a real task, not a quick
text answer — so the game opens within ~1s of it instead of waiting out the full
debounce. Pure-reasoning turns (no tool calls) still render at `debounceSeconds`,
and quick answers that finish inside the debounce never flash a pane at all.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3** (stdlib `curses` only — no `pip install`).
- A place to render the game:
  - **tmux** (auto-detected; the game opens in a split pane and keeps focus on
    Claude Code), **or**
  - a **GUI terminal** — macOS `Terminal.app`, or a Linux emulator
    (`gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `alacritty`, `kitty`, `xterm`, … or whatever
    `$TERMINAL` points to).
- On a bare SSH session with neither, the game no-ops and logs a one-time note
  (see [Limitations](#limitations)).

---

## Install

### Option A — personal install (fastest)

Wires the hooks into your `~/.claude/settings.json` **in place** (no file
copying, so `git pull` keeps you current) and seeds a default config:

```bash
scripts/install.sh              # hooks + default config
scripts/install.sh --spinner    # also set trivia-fact spinnerVerbs (M0)
scripts/install.sh --uninstall  # remove the hooks
```

Restart Claude Code (or run `/hooks`) afterward.

### Option B — shareable plugin

The repo is already laid out as a plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` +
`hooks/hooks.json`). Test it locally:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./idle-games
# iterate with /reload-plugins
```

To distribute, add it to a plugin marketplace repo and install with `/plugin`.

## How it plays

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`–`4` | Answer / repeat pads (Simon) |
| `wasd` / arrows | Steer (snake) |
| `SPACE` | Match signal (n-back) |
| `s` | Skip (multiple-choice games) |
| `g` | Switch to the next game |
| `p` | Pause / resume |
| `q` | Quit the game (won't respawn until your next prompt) |
| `Q` | Quit for the **rest of this session** |

## Turning it off

Four scopes, checked in this order by the `UserPromptSubmit` hook:

| Scope | How |
|-------|-----|
| One session | Launch with the env var: `IDLE_GAMES=off claude` (hooks inherit the CLI's environment). |
| One project | `touch .no-idle-games` in the repo root — that directory stays game-free for everyone/every session. |
| Rest of the current session | Press `Q` in the game. |
| Everywhere, until re-enabled | `"enabled": false` in `~/.claude/trivia/config.json`. |

Notifications about Claude waiting on you are independent of the game and
still fire when the game is off; silence those with
`"systemNotifications": false`.

Each answer shows instant correct/incorrect feedback + a one-line explanation,
then advances. A running streak and accuracy sit in the header. Lifetime and
daily-streak stats persist to `~/.claude/trivia/stats.json`.

When Claude finishes, the game shows **"✅ Claude's done — final score"** and
closes according to your `stopBehavior`.

---

## Configuration

Edit `~/.claude/trivia/config.json` (seeded from
[`game/config.example.json`](game/config.example.json)):

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "debounceSeconds": 8,
  "stopBehavior": "linger",
  "lingerSeconds": 2,
  "paneHeight": 12,
  "categories": ["tech", "science", "general", "history"],
  "fallbackWithoutTmux": "terminal-window",
  "autoCloseTerminal": true,
  "sound": false
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `enabled` | Master on/off switch. |
| `debounceSeconds` | Wait this long before rendering, so **quick turns never flash a pane**. If Claude finishes first, the game never appears. With `openOnToolUse` this is the *fallback* for turns that never call a tool (e.g. pure-reasoning answers). |
| `openOnToolUse` | Render as soon as Claude makes its **first tool call** of the turn (a reliable "this is a real task" signal) instead of waiting out the full debounce. Default `true`. |
| `stopBehavior` | `immediate` (close at once), `linger` (show the summary for `lingerSeconds`, default), or `finish-question` (let you complete the current question first). |
| `lingerSeconds` | Summary dwell time for `linger`. |
| `paneHeight` | tmux split height, in rows. |
| `games` | Which games are enabled (see the table up top). `g` cycles through these. |
| `game` | Which game starts a session: a game name (default `poker`), or `random`. |
| `nbackN` | N for the n-back game (default 2). |
| `pokerLLM` | `true` = villain decisions + coach lines via `claude -p` (spends API tokens; ~1–3s per decision). Any failure/timeout silently falls back to the offline bots. Subprocesses run with `IDLE_GAMES=off` so headless hooks can't spawn games recursively. Default `false`. |
| `pokerLLMModel` | Model for the poker LLM layer (default `haiku`). |
| `categories` | Trivia: which categories to draw from (also which ones `--refresh` pulls). |
| `autoCloseTerminal` | On macOS Terminal.app / iTerm2, auto-close the game's own window on wrap-up. Set `false` if you'd rather close it yourself. |
| `systemNotifications` | macOS notification when Claude is waiting on your input (approval, question, idle). Default `true`. |

## Question bank

Ships with ~60 hand-written questions across **tech, science, general, and
history** in [`game/questions.json`](game/questions.json). Option order is
shuffled at load time, so the correct answer isn't always the same key.

Grow the bank from the free [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com) whenever you
like — this is a manual, offline-safe step (**the game never blocks on the
network**):

```bash
python3 game/trivia.py --refresh --amount 100
```

Fetched questions are HTML-unescaped, de-duplicated against what you already
have, and merged in. A network failure leaves the existing bank untouched.

---

## Try it without Claude Code

```bash
# Play directly (Ctrl-C to exit):
python3 game/trivia.py --session test --state-dir /tmp/trivia-test

# In another shell, simulate Claude finishing:
touch /tmp/trivia-test/test.stop
```

---

## M0: trivia in the spinner itself

Independent of the game, you can replace Claude Code's spinner verbs with
"Did you know…" facts (`scripts/install.sh --spinner`, or set `spinnerVerbs`
manually from [`game/spinner-facts.json`](game/spinner-facts.json)). Zero code
risk — even the spinner then carries content.

---

## Limitations

- **GUI-terminal auto-close:** in a **tmux** pane the game closes itself cleanly
  when it exits. On **macOS Terminal.app / iTerm2** the game also auto-closes its
  own window on wrap-up (matched by tty, fired detached so no "terminate running
  processes?" prompt appears) — disable with `"autoCloseTerminal": false`. On
  other Linux GUI emulators the game exits and prints "safe to close this
  window," but whether the *window* itself closes depends on that terminal's
  "close on clean exit" setting. tmux is still the smoothest experience.
- **Bare SSH, no tmux:** nothing to render into — the hook logs a one-time note
  to `~/.claude/trivia/trivia.log` and stays silent. `screen` support is a
  future candidate.
- **Subagents:** only the main-agent `Stop` closes the game; `SubagentStop` is
  intentionally not wired, so subagents finishing mid-run don't end your game.

---

## State & logs

Everything runtime lives under `~/.claude/trivia/`, keyed by `session_id`:
`<session>.pid`, `<session>.pane`, `<session>.stop`, `<session>.pending`, `<session>.go`, `<session>.attn`, `game.lock`,
plus `stats.json` (flock-guarded for multiple concurrent sessions) and
`trivia.log`. `SessionEnd` cleans a session's markers up.
